This is a demo application used to showcase why developer's should care about the security of their workstation. 

This is not an example of good security in web applications. Please do not use this for anything else than a demo. 

Bad practices found here: 
- Weak passwords
- Hardcoded passwords
- OTP that is not an OTP (123456 works always, for everyone)
- Exceptions handling is the exception, not the rule
